# SensorLLM

* AIBT
* Requested topic: A Sensor LLM regarding the heat index and alternating staff based on Children's internal temperatures.
* **The central goal is to encompass the full scope of such a system from start to finish.**
* Ex: a sensor alerts you when the heat index is above a certain point in your area and sends you a notification. Where do you start with the idea and develop the LLM for it and then how do you take that product and sell it to a client or company

## Use case 1

* People walking on a hallway
* sensors are looking at them
* all kinds of sensors
* collecting data that is sent to the LLM
* the LLM can create advertisement infiormation
* to display on screens in the hallway

## Use case 2

* look at a child metrics
* and have an AI agents act as a nurse


##  Ex: a sensor alerts you when the heat index is above a certain point in your area and sends you a notification.

* IOT
* SQL
* cron

## LLM options

* Get Inference GPU vs. cloud
* GPU and cloud
* GPU are expensive upfront ($5k <)
* Cloud - rate limits
* hybrid approach 

## Where do you start with the idea and develop the LLM for it 

* AI Agents
* CrewAI
* ollama run llama3.2
* Code: https://github.com/rcalix1/AgentsAI/tree/main/crewAI
* Use this one: https://github.com/rcalix1/AgentsAI/tree/main 

## and then how do you take that product and sell it to a client or company

# Master Class: Automation and Implementation Strategies with LLMs

---

## Part 1: Framing the Problem (10 min)

### What happens when LLMs meet the real world?

* High-level overview of LLMs — think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. Emphasize that these are general-purpose language models trained to understand and generate human-like text.
* Explain why they are transformative: They can summarize, classify, reason, and even generate business logic from messy inputs.
* Key distinction: LLMs don’t just chat — they **automate decision-making at scale**.

### SensorLLM Concept Introduction:

* Present the idea of SensorLLM: LLMs embedded into real-world workflows that start from physical sensors and end with intelligent action.
* Emphasize that automation isn't just replacing workers — it's enhancing judgment in environments where quick, complex decisions matter.

## Part 2: SensorLLM Deep Dive (30 min)

### Use Case A: Heat Index Monitoring in Schools

* Situation: School staff need to monitor outdoor play during extreme heat.
* Sensor detects rising heat index or elevated internal temps in children.
* LLM interprets:

  * "3 children in Zone B are at risk due to sustained high body temp."
  * Suggests: "Rotate staff. Initiate cool-down protocol."

**Backend flow:** Sensors → SQL DB → Cron trigger → LLM prompt → Notification

### Use Case B: Real-Time Advertising in Hallways

* Scenario: People walk down a corridor with multiple cameras and motion sensors.
* Data fed into an LLM can identify demographics, behavior patterns.
* Example: "Man in 40s slows down near vending machine → display iced tea ad."
* LLM turns raw sensor logs into targeted, in-the-moment content generation.

### Use Case C: AI Nurse Assistant

* Application in child care or elder care.
* Wearables stream health data (heart rate, movement, temperature).
* LLM agent (e.g., CrewAI) acts like a nurse: "Child 7 has elevated pulse and dehydration risk. Recommend fluid intake."
* Add emotion awareness: agent could also send comforting messages or alert a human nurse.

## Part 3: From Idea to MVP (20 min)

### Building SensorLLM 

**Step-by-step process for building automation with LLMs:**

1. **Identify the trigger:** What real-world event or sensor output should begin the automation?
2. **Capture the data:** Use IoT devices, apps, or existing logs. Store in SQL or cloud.
3. **Schedule and trigger:** Use cron or a no-code tool (e.g., Zapier) to call the LLM.
4. **Create the LLM prompt:** Explain the context, ask for a decision or summary.
5. **Return output:** Display, notify, or feed into another action (email, Slack, speaker, etc.)

### Tools Used:

* LLM: `ollama run llama3.2`
* Agent framework: CrewAI (see GitHub repo)
* Triggers: cron job or sensor API call

## Part 4: Business Model & Monetization (20 min)

### Channels for Outreach:

* **YouTube**: Create demo content — show real examples of LLMs handling decision flows.
* **Patreon**: Offer deeper access to build walkthroughs, updates, and early prototypes.
* **Kickstarter**: Use crowdfunding to launch niche LLM automation tools (SensorLLM kits).

### Selling to Clients:

* **Schools**: Safety and efficiency for student health.
* **Retail**: Personalized marketing on screens.
* **Healthcare**: Remote wellness agents for assisted living.
* **Construction or logistics**: Monitor workforce stress, hazards, and environment.

## Part 5: VC and Scaling Path (5 min)

### Target VCs:

Identify venture firms focused on applied AI, industrial automation, health tech, and IoT. Emphasize SensorLLM as a vertical AI opportunity that integrates physical sensing with high-level reasoning.

### Sample VC Comparison Table

### Talking to Investors:

* Frame SensorLLM as a **vertical AI platform** — bridging the physical world and autonomous action.
* Show the data loop: Sensor → LLM → Decision → Human/Agent Response
* Emphasize scalability and horizontal applicability across industries.
* Highlight the long-term vision: SensorLLM is the foundation for adaptive, real-time infrastructure.

## Part 7: Wrap-Up + Q\&A (5 min)

### Final Slide Summary:

> “From sensor → to data → to decision → to deployment → to revenue.”

### Questions to seed:

* “What repetitive decisions in your org could be LLM-powered?”
* “Do you already have data that just needs interpretation?”
* “Can you pilot one high-impact flow with no code at all?”

Encourage follow-ups and offer to share the CrewAI GitHub repo or demo walkthroughs post-session.
